# Syntax
"""
The syntax of the Python programming language is the 
set of rules that defines how a 
Python program will be written and interpreted

"""

"""
Python is case sensitive
num is not the same as Num

"""
# Hashtag is used for single comments

"""
This is a multiline comment (DocString)

What is the difference between docstring and comment in Python?
Documenting in Python with Docstrings
Docstrings explain what a function/class is needed for (i.e., its description, arguments, and output â€” and any other useful information) while comments explain what specific code strings do. 
In other words, code comments are for people who want to modify the code, and docstrings are for people who want to use the code.

Note!!
Comments do not form part of the codes. They are ignored by the intepreter. They only describe and or explain what a code does and or how to modify it.

# A code to return a list of all users (Comment example...)
# Then Codes here...


# The print function ...
print("We are learning python")

# Strings

# A string a character or multiple characters put in a single or double quotaton marks
print("This is a double string")
print('This is a single string')

# The eroor = 'Kofi's mum'
# Backslash \ to fix the error
# Escape character

print('kofi\'s mum')

# Using the double quote
print("Kofi's mum")

# Python using indentication to inteprete codes

# Variable
# Variables a name given to a values in the computers memory
boy = "Kofi"

print(boy)
